# MATLAB

MATLAB code I have written for a numerical methods course. 
The assignment and project report are both included as PDFs.
There are two .m functions that are called in the main script. 
One of them contains the entire problem solution with only one input. 
This was done for ease of writting since only one thing was varied.
